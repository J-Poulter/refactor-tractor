### Refactor Tractor - What's Cookin'

#### Abstract
This is the first group project from Mod2 at Turing School of Software and Design. This program focuses on using Object-oriented programming (OOP) to perform data manipulation and test-driven development (TDD) to implement a robust testing suite. We were given a codebase written in vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and had to refactor, fix broken functionality, reduce redundancies, convert JS to jQuery, test with Chai spies, fetch data from a dataset, run accessibility audits, and convert CSS to Sass/Scsss.

When the user opens the dashboard, they can view a cookbook of recipes. The user can select recipes to add to their favorites or their recipes to cook list and view each of those lists. The user can also search for specific recipes with the search bar. The user can click a specific recipe to see the required ingredients, cost, and missing ingredients. They can click one button to purchase needed ingredients and add them to their pantry or another button to "cook" the recipe and remove the necessary ingredients from their pantry.

#### Project Next Steps
In the creation of this project, we focused mainly on data and functionality. Moving forward, we'd like to revamp the design of the site to have a cleaner, more modern look that enhances UI/UX. We would also like to implement a feature where the user can view their pantry and contents outside of the context of a recipe.
